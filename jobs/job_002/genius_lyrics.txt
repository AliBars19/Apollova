34 ContributorsNo Guidance Lyrics
I just want him blessin' me
I don't want your bag, give your best to me
Shorty got the bread and the recipe
He already know it, why she testin' me? Uh
I'm so fly, I rock Margiela
I won't die 'til I get better
Money and clout won't get me wetter
I need real love, I need hella
Before I die, I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully you don't leave on your own
Before I die, I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully you don't leave on your own
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hopefully you don't leave on your own
Got the car, got the keys, what you on?
Pick a nigga or an internet star
Promise you, neither of 'em pleasin' at all
None of these niggas is down to play part
God knows what he does to my heart
Before I die, I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully you don't leave on your own
Before I die, I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully you don't leave on your own
I don't even wanna go back home
I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully you don't leave on your own
Yeah, oh, oh
Baby, you got my heart
None of these niggas is fuckin with your spot, ooh
Shorty ain't fuckin' a player
All them lame bitches got the key to they heart, ooh
Ain't built like that
None of them niggas is gettin' in my bed, ooh
Shorty ain't built like that
Baby, I got you
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
I don't, I don't, oh
I don't wanna play no games, play no games, ooh
All these lame niggas keep pissin' me off
All them lame bitches tryna fuck with your heart
I know what you want, I ain't fucking you off
Bae, you deserve it all, I know who you are
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
I don't, I don't, ooh
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
I don't, I don't, ayy-ayy
I don't, I don't, oh
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
