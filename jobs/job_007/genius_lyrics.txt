I said (Oh), okay, okay, okay (Oh), okey-dokey, my infatuation (Woo)
Is translatin' to another form of, what you call it? (Love)
(Oh) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah (Oh), I ain't met you, I've been lookin' (Woo)
Stop the waitin' 'fore I stop the chasin', like a alcoholic
"You don't understand me"  – What the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes (Yeah) (Woo)
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh
20/20, 20/20 visions
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—

One more time?
