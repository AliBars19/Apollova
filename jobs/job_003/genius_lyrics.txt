She's high (High)
She lives in the sky
Tonight, she's satisfied (Satisfied)
Rolling back her eyes
But then, she starts to cry (To cry)
Everything is turning to black
All in one night (One night)
She just went to heaven and back (She went)
Yeah, ooh yeah (Oh yeah)
She went to heaven and back, ooh yeah, uh
She went to heaven and back (Yuh, yuh)
Now everything is turning to black
All in one night (One night)
She just went to heaven and back
Heaven and back
Heaven and back
Heaven and back

You said you were fine
But now you're terrified
'Cause you don't wanna die (Die)
Then you start to cry
You wish that you could take it all back
'Cause you just went to heaven and back
She's high (High)
She lives in the sky
Tonight, she's satisfied (Satisfied)
Rolling back her eyes
But then, she starts to cry (To cry)
Everything is turning to black
All in one night (One night)
She just went to heaven and back
Yeah, ooh yeah (Oh yeah)
She went to heaven and back, ooh yeah, uh
She went to heaven and back
Now everything is turning to black
All in one night (One night)
She just went to heaven and back
