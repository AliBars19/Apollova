Alright so we encountered a fatal error
while testing on yaq's system where an FFMPEG
error was not caught. This meant setup.exe
worked properly but apollova.exe would launch
with an error code and close instantly, looking
like a virus.

The two errors was FFMPEG PATH not being
detected and that error not being caught
so ive added multiple try, catch to fix that

the second error was a broken of pytorch being
installed on the yaq's computer with
python 3.14.0. what we are doing to fix that
is uninstalling all versions of pytorch on
the users computer and reinstalling the version
of pytorch that works for us specifically.
