I met that girl right up at my show, left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before, told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this not my city show, but I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Yeah, I am not slow, these girls just want me, 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (What?)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (Yeah, yeah)
Damn, I just started it (Started), man, I just started it (Started)
Oh my God, please, do not bother me
Don't got enough just to order me (Yeah)
I'm on that tree like an ornament
Money so long like accordion (Woo)
You lied to me, wasn't sorry then
On the weekend, you was partyin'
It was just me, you was targetin' (Yeah)
It was just me, you was targetin' (Target)
Jump in the Porsche, I might target it (Skrrt)
Jump in the Lamb', I ain't parkin' it (Skrrt)
Ice is so cold, I snowboard in it (Blaow)
Go to my show, they applaud me in
She call my phone with emergency (Ayy)
She call my phone with that urgency (Ayy)
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (Woo, ayy)
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?", yeah
She said, "I need a new whip," yeah (Skrrt)
"'Cause I know that you still ballin'" (Ball)
She just wanna go back to the future, so, I brought that girl a DeLorean (Yah)
Twenty-one minutes until I got' go, so, I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it (Yeah)

Listen, this not my city show, but I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
